# Object-Detection-using-tensorflow

## Brief Summary
*Last updated: with TensorFlow v1.15.*

This repository is a tutorial for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Windows 10, 8, or 7. (It will also work on Linux-based OSes with some minor changes.) It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.15, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow.

I will also make a YouTube video that walks through this tutorial. Any discrepancies between the video and this written tutorial are due to updates required for using newer versions of TensorFlow. 

**If there are differences between this written tutorial and the video, follow the written tutorial!**

This readme describes every step required to get going with your own object detection classifier:
